<h1>Strings in Java</h1>
**1. String Overview

<h3>Definition:</h3> String is a class in Java that represents a sequence of characters.
Immutable: Strings are immutable in Java, meaning once a String object is created, it cannot be changed. Any modification results in the creation of a new String object.
<h3>
**2. Creating Strings</h3>

Literal: String str = "Hello";
Constructor: String str = new String("Hello");
Empty String: String empty = "";
**3. Common Methods

Length: str.length() - Returns the length of the string.
Concat: str.concat(" World") - Concatenates another string.
Substring: str.substring(beginIndex, endIndex) - Extracts a substring.
CharAt: str.charAt(index) - Returns the character at the specified index.
IndexOf: str.indexOf("search") - Returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring.
Replace: str.replace("old", "new") - Replaces occurrences of a substring.
ToLowerCase/ToUpperCase: str.toLowerCase() / str.toUpperCase() - Converts the string to lowercase or uppercase.
Trim: str.trim() - Removes leading and trailing whitespace.
Split: str.split("delimiter") - Splits the string into an array based on the delimiter.
**4. String Comparison

Equals: str1.equals(str2) - Checks if two strings are equal.
EqualsIgnoreCase: str1.equalsIgnoreCase(str2) - Checks equality ignoring case.
CompareTo: str1.compareTo(str2) - Compares two strings lexicographically.
<h3>
**5. String Pool</h3>

Interning: Strings created with literals are stored in a common pool (interned). Using new String("literal") creates a new object, bypassing the pool.
**6. StringBuilder and StringBuffer

Mutable Strings: Use StringBuilder or StringBuffer for mutable strings.
StringBuilder: Non-synchronized, faster.

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" World");
StringBuffer: Synchronized, thread-safe.

StringBuffer sbf = new StringBuffer("Hello");
sbf.append(" World");
**7. Common Use Cases

String Manipulation: Concatenation, substring extraction, and pattern matching.
String Formatting: Using String.format() or printf() for formatted output.
**8. Performance Considerations

Immutability: Immutable strings can lead to higher memory usage and performance overhead when concatenating strings in loops. Prefer StringBuilder for such use cases.
**9. Regular Expressions

Pattern Matching: Use Pattern and Matcher classes for regex operations.

Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("regex");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("input");
boolean matches = matcher.matches();

<h2>
Sample Questions
</h2>
How do you create a String in Java?

You can create a String using a string literal (e.g., String str = "Hello";) or a String constructor (e.g., String str = new String("Hello");).
What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer?

String is immutable, while StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable. StringBuilder is not synchronized, whereas StringBuffer is synchronized.
How can you reverse a string in Java?

Using StringBuilder:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
String reversed = sb.reverse().toString();
How does the intern() method work?

The intern() method returns a canonical representation of the string object. If the string is already in the string pool, it returns the reference from the pool; otherwise, it adds the string to the pool.
What is the significance of immutability in strings?

Immutability provides safety and thread-safety. It ensures that once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed, which avoids unintended side effects.

In Java,<h1> the == operator</h1> is used for comparison, but its behavior varies depending on the type of operands it is comparing. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how == works with different data types:

1. Primitive Types
For primitive data types (such as int, float, char, etc.), the == operator compares the actual values directly.

Example:

int a = 5;
int b = 5;
boolean result = (a == b); // true, because 5 is equal to 5
2. Reference Types
For reference types (such as String, Object, arrays, and custom classes), the == operator compares the memory addresses (references) of the objects, not their content. This means it checks if both references point to the same object in memory.

Example:

String s1 = new String("Hello");
String s2 = new String("Hello");
boolean result = (s1 == s2); // false, because s1 and s2 refer to different objects in memory

String s3 = "Hello";
String s4 = "Hello";
boolean result2 = (s3 == s4); // true, because s3 and s4 refer to the same object in the string pool
Key Points to Note
String Literals and the String Pool:

String literals are interned and stored in a common pool. If you create two String objects using literals with the same value, they will refer to the same object.
Example:

String str1 = "Java";
String str2 = "Java";
boolean result = (str1 == str2); // true
Using new Keyword:

When you use the new keyword to create a String, a new object is created in memory, even if the content is the same as another string.
Example:

String str1 = new String("Java");
String str2 = new String("Java");
boolean result = (str1 == str2); // false
Object Comparison:

For custom objects, == checks if two references point to the same instance. To compare the contents of objects, you should override the equals() method in your class.
Example:

class Person {
    String name;

    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (this == obj) return true;
        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;
        Person person = (Person) obj;
        return name != null ? name.equals(person.name) : person.name == null;
    }
}

Person p1 = new Person("Alice");
Person p2 = new Person("Alice");
boolean result = (p1 == p2); // false, different instances
boolean result2 = p1.equals(p2); // true, same content
Null Checks:

If either reference is null, == will return false unless both references are null.
Example:
java
String s1 = null;
String s2 = null;
boolean result = (s1 == s2); // true
Summary
Primitive types: == compares actual values.
Reference types: == compares memory addresses (references).
For content-based comparison of objects (including strings), use the equals() method.
Be cautious with == when working with reference types, especially with strings and custom objects.
